### 👋 Hi! I'm a self-taught iOS Developer. Here's a bit of what I've been working on.

## Creator View
Creator View is an app developed by Sean Allen that helps YouTubers get a bigger picture of their business. 
<br>I have had the opportunity to contribute to a few areas of this app. Check it out below!

## [SafePeople](https://github.com/brittanyarima/SafePeople) 
`📲 Available on the App Store`
<br>Safe People was an idea my sister came up with and I had the honor of bringing to life. The purpose of the app is to help those struggling with addiction, anxiety, depression, etc.. reach out to their Safe People in times of need. When "triggered" the user can open the app and simply press the 'Safe Button'. This will prepare a pre-written customizable message that will be ready to send to their trusted people. The message and their trusted contacts will auto-populate in their iPhone's message app, and all they have to do is press "send".

## [MovieDB](https://github.com/brittanyarima/MovieDB)
MovieDB is a classic 'Movie Database App' built with SwiftUI. This app utilizes the TMDB API and shows users information about popular and newly released movies, as well as giving the user the ability to search for a specific movie.

## [Budgeteer](https://github.com/brittanyarima/foodBudgeteer)
This app has been a passion project of mine over the past couple years. I started building this when I first started learning SwiftUI. It's been a project I love to go back to and practice new designs and different things I've learned. Budgeteer is a food budgeting app for some of the biggest theme parks in the world.

## Chord Trainer
This is an app I built for a freelance client. This client wanted the core of an app that they could eventually expand on with their own design. Chord Trainer is a flashcard game that helps piano students practice chords. Students can choose their game settings on the home screen (adjust how fast the flash cards will change, as well as choose the duration of the game). Once the game begins, the piano chords will filter through in a random order and without repeating until the student has practiced all the chords. This was a fun app to build since I also play piano! It was also a nice challenge of working with Timers. Most of all, it was an incredible experience to get to work with a client and bring their idea to life!
