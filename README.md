Hi! I'm a self-taught iOS Developer with a love for design, tech, and a desire to never stop learning. My goal is to help create applications that enrich people's lives. Here is some of my work!



**MOVIEDB**

MovieDB is an iOS app using SwiftUI. This app is a classic "Movie Database App" that utilizes the TMDB API and shows users information about popular and newly released movies, as well as giving the user the ability to search for a specific movie. This app was a fun project to learn and practice API calls. 

Tech used: SwiftUI, MVVM, TMDB API.
