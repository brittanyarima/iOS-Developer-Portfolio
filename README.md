Hi! I'm a self-taught iOS Developer with a love for design, tech, and a desire to never stop learning. My goal is to help create applications that enrich people's lives. Here is some of my work!



**MOVIEDB**

MovieDB is an iOS app using SwiftUI. This app is a classic "Movie Database App" that utilizes the TMDB API and shows users information about popular and newly released movies, as well as giving the user the ability to search for a specific movie. This app was a fun project to learn and practice API calls. 

Tech used: SwiftUI, MVVM, TMDB API.


**[SafePeople](https://github.com/brittanyarima/SafePeople)**

SafePeople is an app close to my heart. This was a collaboration with my sister, an idea she came up with that I had the honor to be able to bring to life. SafePeople is an app geared toward individuals who are struggling with addiction, anxiety, depression, or just need a little help reaching out for support from their trusted people. 

When an individual feels anxious, tempted, or in need of help, they can open the SafePeople app and simply press the "Safe" button and it prepare a text message to be sent to their trusted people. We know how difficult it can be to reach out when in need of help, so this is a attempt to try and help people get help when they need it!

Tech used: SwiftUI, CoreData, AppStorage

**Budgeteer**

This app has been a passion project of mine over the past year. I started building this when I first started learning SwiftUI. It's been a project I love to go back to and practice new design and things I've learned. This app is a food budgeting app for some of the biggest theme parks in the world. 

Tech used: API, SwiftUI, Core Data, Swift Package Manager

**ProjectView**

This is an app to help people stay productive and keep track of their projects. Users can add new Projects to keep track of, and add to-do items to each project. I use Core Data to save each project, local notifications to send the user reminders, spotlight search capabilities, and accessibilty features to help when voice over is enabled. 

Tech used: SwiftUI, Core Data, Unit Tests/UI Tests, Haptics, Spotlight Search, Local Notifications

**Marvel Characters**

This app was built as a way to brush up on UIKit. I'm a big Marvel fan, so using the Marvel API was a must! The app is a simple Table View, made completely programmatically. 

Tech used: UIKit, Networking, SDWebImage Framework, CryptoKit
