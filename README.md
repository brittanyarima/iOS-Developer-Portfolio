### 👋 Hi! I'm a self-taught iOS Developer. Here's a bit of what I've been working on.

# [Clockology](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/clockology/id1456386228)
(Contract Work)
I've had the opportunity to contribute to this incredible iOS App. Using SwiftUI, I've helped refresh some of the designs, implement a new generic Calendar and Chart layer for users to add to their watch faces, and help with various bug fixes.



## Sneak Peek 👀
Here are a few updates I've been hacking away at for Magic Budget. This update is yet to be ready for the App Store, but here's a sneak peek at some new things coming to Magic Budget in the next update!

What's new?
- A refreshed Home Screen
- Updated UI
- App-wide consistency in Buttons/Textfield/Sheet styles
- To make it a bit more fun, I've added the ability for users to customize each trip with a color and icon
- I incorporated the Queue-Times API to show Disneyland's current wait times on the Home Screen
- More to come!


## Magic Budget
This app has been a passion project of mine over the past couple years. Magic Budget is a Disney Parks budget planning app. Me and my husband absolutely love going to the parks but we always find ourselves coming over budget (too many churros). I built this app to help solve this problem! I found the estimated price for many of the popular items in the parks so users can quickly budget for what they might buy on their trip.

## [SafePeople](https://github.com/brittanyarima/SafePeople) 
`📲 Available on the App Store`
<br>Safe People was an idea my sister came up with and I had the honor of bringing to life. The purpose of the app is to help those struggling with addiction, anxiety, depression, etc.. reach out to their Safe People in times of need. When "triggered" the user can open the app and simply press the 'Safe Button'. This will prepare a pre-written customizable message that will be ready to send to their trusted people. The message and their trusted contacts will auto-populate in their iPhone's message app, and all they have to do is press "send".

## [Steps](https://github.com/brittanyarima/Steps)
[`📲 Available on the App Store`](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1663569893)

Steps is a step counting app built with SwiftUI and utilizing HealthKit. This was a fun app to build! The home screen has a fun visual of how close the user is to their goal. The detail screen is built with a custom circle graph and a Swift Charts bar chart to show the user their weekly steps. The Awards tab encourages the user to keep taking steps to unlock awards each week. The Settings tab gives the user the option to change their daily steps goal and to enable or disable notifications. Check out more details in this repo at the link above!

## [MovieDB](https://github.com/brittanyarima/MovieDB)
MovieDB is a classic 'Movie Database App' built with SwiftUI. This app utilizes the TMDB API and shows users information about popular and newly released movies, as well as giving the user the ability to search for a specific movie.

## Chord Trainer
This is an app I built for a freelance client. This client wanted the core of an app that they could eventually expand on with their own design. Chord Trainer is a flashcard game that helps piano students practice chords. Students can choose their game settings on the home screen (adjust how fast the flash cards will change, as well as choose the duration of the game). Once the game begins, the piano chords will filter through in a random order and without repeating until the student has practiced all the chords. This was a fun app to build since I also play piano! It was also a nice challenge of working with Timers. Most of all, it was an incredible experience to get to work with a client and bring their idea to life!

## [Sketchy](https://github.com/brittanyarima/Sketchy)
An iPad sketch app built with PencilKit, SwiftUI, & UIKit. This project tested my ability to integrate UIKit with a SwiftUI project when needed. This project required UIKit compenents for the Canvas, as well as to give the user the ability to share their artwork. 
PencilKit is a powerhouse and central to this app, giving the user the ability to choose their drawing tools, colors, and the ability to erase and undo their changes. I also added toolbar items that give the user the ability to clear the whole canvas, undo, and share their drawing or save to their device.
