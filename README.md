### 👋 Hi! I'm a self-taught freelance/indie iOS Developer. Here's a bit of what I've been working on.

# [Clockology](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/clockology/id1456386228)
(Contract Work)
I've have the opportunity to contribute to this incredible iOS/watchOS App. Using SwiftUI, I've helped refresh some of the designs, implement a new generic Calendar and Chart layer for users to add to their watch faces, and help with various bug fixes and design updates. This is ongoing work and just a few examples of the things I've had the opportunity to work on.

- 💬 Wrote a Python script to help with the app's localization
- 📊 Built a generic chart layer with SwiftCharts to handle the data and settings the User chooses to use
- 🔹 Helped add custom watch hands to the app usings custom SwiftUI Shapes
- 📲 Incorporated tap gestures to improve the watch face editor experience
  
[//]: # " - ⌚️ Added a watch band preview feature so users can see what their face could like like with popular band options"
- Other UI and bug fixes

# [AppIdeaasApp](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/appideasapp/id6476480047)
My most recent app I built and released on the App Store. I created this app out of personal need. I have SO MANY random app ideas and wanted a place I could easily keep track of them. AppIdeasApp lets you create app ideas, brainstorm everything from name ideas, feature ideas, color schemes, and more. Less forgetting. More building. More shipping. I wanted to challenge my design skills on this project and had fun adding some animations (all with SwiftUI of course!)

# [Magic Budget](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magic-budget/id6447111418)
This app has been a passion project of mine over the past couple years. Magic Budget is a Disney Parks budget planning app. Me and my husband absolutely love going to the parks but we always find ourselves coming over budget (too many churros). I built this app to help solve this problem! I found the estimated price for many of the popular items in the parks so users can quickly budget for what they might buy on their trip.

## [SafePeople](https://github.com/brittanyarima/SafePeople) 
`📲 Available on the App Store`
<br>Safe People was an idea my sister came up with and I had the honor of bringing to life. The purpose of the app is to help those struggling with addiction, anxiety, depression, etc.. reach out to their Safe People in times of need. When "triggered" the user can open the app and simply press the 'Safe Button'. This will prepare a pre-written customizable message that will be ready to send to their trusted people. The message and their trusted contacts will auto-populate in their iPhone's message app, and all they have to do is press "send".

<br>Here's a sneak peek at the next update currently in the works!

[`📲 Available on the App Store`](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1663569893)

Steps is a step counting app built with SwiftUI and utilizing HealthKit. This was a fun app to build! The home screen has a fun visual of how close the user is to their goal. The detail screen is built with a custom circle graph and a Swift Charts bar chart to show the user their weekly steps. The Awards tab encourages the user to keep taking steps to unlock awards each week. The Settings tab gives the user the option to change their daily steps goal and to enable or disable notifications. Check out more details in this repo at the link above!

## Chord Trainer
This is an app I built for a freelance client. This client wanted the core of an app that they could eventually expand on with their own design. Chord Trainer is a flashcard game that helps piano students practice chords. Students can choose their game settings on the home screen (adjust how fast the flash cards will change, as well as choose the duration of the game). Once the game begins, the piano chords will filter through in a random order and without repeating until the student has practiced all the chords. This was a fun app to build since I also play piano! It was also a nice challenge of working with Timers. Most of all, it was an incredible experience to get to work with a client and bring their idea to life!
