## [SafePeople](https://github.com/brittanyarima/SafePeople) 
`📲 Available on the App Store`
<br>Safe People was an idea my sister came up with and I had the honor of bringing to life. The purpose of the app is to help those struggling with addiction, anxiety, depression, etc.. reach out to their Safe People in times of need. When "triggered" the user can open the app and simply press the 'Safe Button'. This will prepare a pre-written customizable message that will be ready to send to their trusted people. The message and their trusted contacts will auto-populate in their iPhone's message app, and all they have to do is press "send".

## [MovieDB](https://github.com/brittanyarima/MovieDB)
MovieDB is a classic 'Movie Database App' built with SwiftUI. This app utilizes the TMDB API and shows users information about popular and newly released movies, as well as giving the user the ability to search for a specific movie.

**Budgeteer**

This app has been a passion project of mine over the past year. I started building this when I first started learning SwiftUI. It's been a project I love to go back to and practice new design and things I've learned. This app is a food budgeting app for some of the biggest theme parks in the world. 

Tech used: API, SwiftUI, Core Data, Swift Package Manager

**ProjectView**

This is an app to help people stay productive and keep track of their projects. Users can add new Projects to keep track of, and add to-do items to each project. I use Core Data to save each project, local notifications to send the user reminders, spotlight search capabilities, and accessibilty features to help when voice over is enabled. 

Tech used: SwiftUI, Core Data, Unit Tests/UI Tests, Haptics, Spotlight Search, Local Notifications

**Marvel Characters**

This app was built as a way to brush up on UIKit. I'm a big Marvel fan, so using the Marvel API was a must! The app is a simple Table View, made completely programmatically. 

Tech used: UIKit, Networking, SDWebImage Framework, CryptoKit
